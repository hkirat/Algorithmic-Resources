## Binary Search and Ternary Search
---
*Binary Search : The process of exploiting the property of an array of being sorted to arrive at answers of questions in non linear time.*

*Ternary Search : The process of exploiting the property of a function having double diffrential of a constant sign to arrive to results in non linear time.*
